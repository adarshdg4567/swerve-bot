## 11/1/2025 11 AM - Create a swerve drive  

The primary goal of this new idea was to put odometry into a swerve drive module. To choose the best setups for the wheels, gears, and motors, I began by sketching out a few design ideas. The goal was to find a small but useful layout that could track movement 
I selected the most promising configuration and moved forward with CAD modeling after going through many revisions and rough drafts, some of which are shown in the sketches below. The CAD phase took the longest since I had to carefully test different gear sizes and locations for smooth motion and low backlash.

## 11/1/2025 12 PM - I assembled the prototype  

I assembled the prototype. It worked pretty well. I had to fix some dimensions in the cad. I caded a bigger prototype that had more gears. I basically made one module of the swerve drivetrain. I also researched about the motors I was going to use. I wanted to have encoder to be more precise.
