## 11/1/2025 11 AM - Create a swerve drive  

The primary goal of this new idea was to put odometry into a swerve drive module. To choose the best setups for the wheels, gears, and motors, I began by sketching out a few design ideas. The goal was to find a small but useful layout that could track movement 
I selected the most promising configuration and moved forward with CAD modeling after going through many revisions and rough drafts, some of which are shown in the sketches below. The CAD phase took the longest since I had to carefully test different gear sizes and locations for smooth motion and low backlash.

## 11/1/2025 12 PM - I assembled the prototype  

I assembled the prototype. It worked pretty well. I had to fix some dimensions in the cad. I caded a bigger prototype that had more gears. I basically made one module of the swerve drivetrain. I also researched about the motors I was going to use. I wanted to have encoder to be more precise.

## 11/1/2025 8 PM - testing the printed prototype today  

The second prototype was tested today, and it worked incredibly well, moving more smoothly and having better control than the first. After that, I spent the majority of the day cadding the entire robot, which took some time because it was difficult to get every joint to function correctly. Everything came together nicely after the constraints were established. Seeing the bot steer and move virtually was incredibly satisfying and made the effort worthwhile. The animation also looked fantastic.
